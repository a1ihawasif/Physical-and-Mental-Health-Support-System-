Libraries used: iostream, string, vector, cstring, cmath, fstream, limits

Compiler: Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code

Technicalities used: If-Else, Switch-Case-Break, Nested Loops (For and While), Functions, Arrays, File-Handling

Working of the Programme: The program asks the user

to enter their name and then create a file (name.txt) for storing the users' history

to enter age and gender

to choose from a menu and then again choose from a sub-menu

Based on these choices and the use of if-else statements, for and while loops and switch case statements the programme makes the user run through the specified cases and then asks the user if they want to go through the process once again. This is achieved by a do-while loop.
